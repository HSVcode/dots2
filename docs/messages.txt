First client (p1):
  * Generates and displays random game ID  (ToDo: Later phase will instead make use of a lobby.)
  * Creates a channel (using the game ID as a suffix)
  * Subscribes to channel
  * Sets current-player to p1

  * Receives Join-request message from channel, then:
    + If number-of-players < max (2), then:
      + Increments number of players
      + Sends Player-added message with player's userId, playerId, and numberOfDots to channel
      + Configures and builds board (setting current-player to p1)
      (Otherwise, message is ignored)


Other clients client (p2+):
  * Accepts game ID from user  (ToDo: Later phase will instead make use of a lobby.)
  * Subscribes to channel (using the game ID as a suffix)
  * Sends Join-request message to channel


All clients:
  * Receives Player-added message from channel
    + If targets my userId, then:

      (Otherwise, message is ignored)

  * If current-player is self,
    + Accepts/draws line from user
    + Sends Line-request message to channel (ToDo: Should have next-player field?)
    + Sets current-player to next (if box not closed)

  * Receives Line-request message from channel
    + If drawer id not me, then
      - Draws it (and any closed boxes)
      - Sets current-player to next (if box not closed)
      (Otherwise, message is ignored)

  * Receives Leave-game message, then:
    + ToDo: This will be easy for 2 players, likely harder for more.

  * If end-of-game / all-boxes-closed, then:
    + Shows end-game popup
    + ToDo: Allow next player to be p1 and restart game.
